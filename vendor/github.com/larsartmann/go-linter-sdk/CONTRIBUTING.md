# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `go-linter-sdk`!

## Prerequisites

This project is part of the LarsArtmann Go ecosystem and follows the same
toolchain conventions as its sibling [`go-finding`](https://github.com/larsartmann/go-finding).

**You need [Nix](https://nixos.org/) with flakes enabled.** All build, test,
and lint commands run inside the Nix dev shell so that the experimental
`GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` flag is set consistently — `go-finding` (a transitive
dependency) uses `encoding/json/v2`, which fails to compile without it.

`go-finding` is resolved from the public module proxy as a published tag (see
`go.mod` for the pinned version — do not duplicate version numbers in prose).
No local `replace` directive and no sibling checkout are needed. For local
cross-repo development against an uncommitted `go-finding`, add a temporary
`go.work` or `replace` line — neither is committed.

## Development Setup

Enter the dev shell — this sets `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` and makes the `reports/`
directory buildflow expects:

```sh
nix develop
```

Then use the flake apps for every common task:

| Command               | What it does                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `nix run .#test`      | Run all tests (`go test ./... -count=1`)    |
| `nix run .#test-race` | Run all tests with the race detector        |
| `nix run .#bench`     | Run benchmarks                              |
| `nix run .#build`     | Build all packages                          |
| `nix run .#vet`       | Run `go vet`                                |
| `nix run .#lint`      | Run `golangci-lint`                         |
| `nix run .#coverage`  | Run tests with coverage and print a summary |
| `nix flake check`     | Validate the flake and run treefmt checks   |

To format code (gofumpt + goimports + golines@120 + nixfmt):

```sh
nix fmt
```

To run the full BuildFlow suite (mirrors CI):

```sh
nix develop --command buildflow
```

## Why `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2` is mandatory

`go-finding` imports `encoding/json/v2` and `encoding/json/jsontext`, which the
Go toolchain gates behind the `jsonv2` experiment. Without the flag, every
build, test, and lint in this repo fails with
"build constraints exclude all Go files in encoding/json/jsontext". The flake
sets it for you — never run plain `go build`/`go test` outside the dev shell.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes in `nix develop`, keeping code formatted with `nix fmt`.
3. Ensure `nix run .#test`, `nix run .#lint`, and `nix flake check` all pass.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under the `[Unreleased]` section.
5. Submit a pull request describing the change and its motivation.

## Examples directory

The `examples/` directory contains standalone CLI programs that demonstrate
the SDK's usage. Each example is a `package main` in its own subdirectory
(e.g., `examples/minimal-linter/`).

Conventions:

- Examples are part of the same Go module — they import
  `github.com/larsartmann/go-linter-sdk` directly.
- `.golangci.yml` excludes `examples/` from `depguard`, `forbidigo`, and `mnd`
  because example CLI code legitimately uses `fmt.Println`, exit codes, and
  unrestricted imports.
- Each example should have integration tests in `examples_integration_test.go`
  (root package) that build the binary, run it on clean/dirty temp dirs, and
  assert exit codes.
- Run examples with `GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go run ./examples/<name> [dir]`.
