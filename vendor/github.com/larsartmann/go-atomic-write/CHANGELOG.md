# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Windows builds now compile** (`rename_windows.go`) — `isRetryableRename` referenced `syscall.ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`, which Go's stdlib `syscall` package does not define on windows (it only exports a small errno subset). Every `GOOS=windows` build of this library — direct or transitive — failed with `undefined: syscall.ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`. The constant is now defined locally by value (`syscall.Errno(32)`, the WinAPI `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` code), preserving the intended retry-on-sharing-violation behavior.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **`WriteWithPerm(path, data, perm)`** — atomic write with explicit file permissions (0.4.0's API always used 0o644).

### Changed

- Test hygiene: zero-length `make` to satisfy the `makezero` linter.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **`WriteIfChanged(path, data) (changed bool, err error)`** — writes only if content differs from disk. Returns `changed=true` when the file was written, `false` when skipped (identical content). This is the idiomatic primitive for config-file writers and code generators that must not produce spurious diffs on re-runs: no content change means no file mutation, no mtime bump, no file-watcher trigger. Composes `FingerprintFile` + `WriteVerified`; first-write uses plain `Write` (no prior content to protect).

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `Write` / `WriteFunc` API split** (`atomicwrite.go`) — the previous `Write(path, data, fingerprint)` mixed two distinct intents behind a zero-value `Fingerprint{}`, which silently skipped TOCTOU verification (a footgun). The API is now split by intent:
  - `Write(path, data)` / `WriteFunc(path, fn)` — plain atomic write, no TOCTOU check (the common case).
  - `WriteVerified(path, data, fingerprint)` / `WriteFuncVerified(path, fn, fingerprint)` — atomic write WITH fingerprint verification. A zero-value fingerprint here means "the file must NOT already exist" — a concurrent creation is treated as a conflict and fails, rather than being silently ignored.
- This is a source-incompatible change: every call site passing `Fingerprint{}` to skip verification migrates to `Write`/`WriteFunc`; every call site passing a real fingerprint migrates to the `*Verified` variant. All in-repo consumers were updated.

### Migration

| Before                                       | After                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `Write(path, data, Fingerprint{})`           | `Write(path, data)`               |
| `Write(path, data, fp)` (real fingerprint)   | `WriteVerified(path, data, fp)`   |
| `WriteFunc(path, fn, Fingerprint{})`         | `WriteFunc(path, fn)`             |
| `WriteFunc(path, fn, fp)` (real fingerprint) | `WriteFuncVerified(path, fn, fp)` |

### Fixed (website & docs)

- **Website docs taught the removed API** — `api-reference.mdx`, `getting-started/quick-start.mdx` (4 examples), `getting-started/installation.mdx`, `guides/error-handling.mdx`, the landing-page hero code (`hero-code.ts`), and the "How it works" steps (`sections.ts`) all used the removed `Write(path, data, fingerprint)` 3-arg signature. Rewritten to the current `Write` / `WriteVerified` / `WriteIfChanged` / `WriteFunc` / `WriteFuncVerified` split.
- **Dual changelog split brain** — `website/src/content/docs/changelog.mdx` duplicated root `CHANGELOG.md` and had already diverged (no `[Unreleased]`, old signatures). The website page is now **generated** from the root file by `website/scripts/sync-changelog.mjs` (single source of truth, wired into `prebuild`/`predev`).
- **`docs/DOMAIN_LANGUAGE.md` documented the removed `.bak` pattern** as a value object and event. Corrected to reflect single-rename atomicity and the full write-API split.
- **`pulse-dot` animation ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`** — the reduced-motion media query only targeted `[data-animate]`. Now disables `.animate-pulse-dot` too (accessibility: vestibular disorders).

### Added (website & CI)

- **Hash-based Content Security Policy** — `website/scripts/fix-csp.mjs` post-build patcher injects a per-file CSP `<meta>` into every built HTML page. Inline scripts are allow-listed by SHA-256 hash (no `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src`); `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is retained for Tailwind's inlined critical CSS.
- **CI/CD pipelines** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Go `vet` + `build` + `test -race` + `golangci-lint`) and `.github/workflows/website.yml` (`typecheck` + `build` on every change; deploy to Firebase Hosting `live` channel on `master`).
- **Changelog sync hook** — `pnpm run sync:changelog` and automatic `prebuild`/`predev` generation of the website changelog page.

### Changed (website & docs)

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — added a `website/` section (build/dev/deploy commands, the generated-changelog note), corrected the stale "No flake.nix" claim (the website has one), and documented `golangci-lint` as the gating check.

### Removed (website)

- **Dead website code** — unused `comparisons` array (`sections.ts`), unused `ComparisonItem` interface (`types.ts`), and the unused `fade-in-up` keyframe + theme variable (`global.css`). `comparisonMatrix` (which IS rendered) is retained.

### Added (website accessibility & social)

- **OG / social-share image** — static 1200×630 `og-image.png` (generated from `og-image.svg` source) with `og:image`, `twitter:image`, and `twitter:card=summary_large_image` meta tags on both the landing page and all Starlight docs pages.
- **`favicon.ico`** — multi-resolution (16/32/48/64px) ICO generated from `favicon.svg`, referenced via `<link rel="alternate icon">` for legacy browsers that only request `.ico`.
- **Lighthouse CI** — `website/lighthouserc.json` with performance/accessibility/SEO budgets (desktop preset), `@lhci/cli` devDependency, `pnpm run lighthouse` script, and `chromium` in the Nix devShell (`CHROME_PATH` set). Verified: Performance 100, Accessibility 100, Best-Practices 96, SEO 100.
- **`website/.editorconfig`** — standalone editor config for the website subtree (2-space indent for all web files, `root = true` to decouple from the Go tab-based root config).

### Fixed (website accessibility)

- **WCAG AA contrast failure** — `--color-text-muted` was `#78716c` (4.08:1 on the dark `#0a0908` background, below the 4.5:1 AA minimum). Dark mode lightened to `#8b827a` (5.28:1); light mode darkened to `#6e6762` (5.32:1) for comfortable margin.
- **Comparison matrix screen-reader inaccessible** — check/X icons in `ComparisonSection.astro` had no text alternative. Each data cell now has a descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "TOCTOU-safe, go-atomic-write: Yes"); feature-name cells changed to `<th scope="row">`; the `~` partial symbol marked `aria-hidden="true"`.

### Changed (website infra)

- **`website/flake.nix` pinned Node 24** — replaced `pkgs.nodejs` (Node 22 on unstable) with `pkgs.nodejs_24` across all apps and devShell, matching the `.node-version` file and AGENTS.md requirement.
- **`website/flake.nix` app metadata** — added `meta.description` and `meta.mainProgram` to every `mkApp` (dev, build, preview, deploy); `nix flake check` no longer warns about missing attributes.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`WriteFunc(path, fn, fingerprint)`** — streaming atomic writes via a callback. The callback receives a `bufio.Writer` (64KB buffer) so callers can stream large or incrementally-produced content (JSON encoders, diagram renderers, etc.) without holding the full payload in memory. The temp file is fsync'd before atomic rename, and TOCTOU fingerprint verification works identically to `Write`.
- **Comprehensive `WriteFunc` tests** — first run, overwrite, large stream (400KB across 100 chunks), callback error cleanup, permission preservation, and no-leftover-files verification

### Changed

- Benchmark data generation extracted into a shared `benchData` helper — eliminates duplicated `make([]byte, size)` + fill-by-index across 4 benchmark functions
- `.gitattributes` added for cross-platform line-ending normalization
- Full marketing website launched with Astro + Starlight + Tailwind v4 at [atomicwrite.lars.software](https://atomicwrite.lars.software)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **Removed `.bak` two-rename pattern** — the old `atomicRename` did `path→.bak` then `tmp→path`, opening a window where the target didn't exist. A concurrent reader could see `ENOENT`, and a crash between the two renames left the target missing. The library named "atomic-write" was not atomic. Now a single `os.Rename(tmp, path)` is one atomic syscall on POSIX and atomically replaces on Windows via `MoveFileEx`.
- **Concurrent writer corruption** — `tmpPath` was computed before the lock (`path + ".tmp"`), so two concurrent `Write()` calls to the same target both truncated and wrote the same staging file, interleaving bytes. Now each writer gets a unique temp file via `crypto/rand` suffix (`path + "." + randomHex + ".tmp"`).
- **Concurrency test couldn't catch the bug** — `TestConcurrentWriteRACE` used identical content from all writers, so byte interleaving was undetectable. Rewritten with 10 writers using divergent content (`writer-0` through `writer-9`) plus an integrity check verifying the final file is exactly one writer's payload.
- **"Crash safety" doc claim was false** — no `fsync` was called anywhere. Now `writeAndSync()` opens the temp file, writes data, calls `file.Sync()`, and closes (with cleanup on error). On POSIX, the target directory is also `fsync`'d after rename via `syncDir()`. The package doc now says "atomic rename, and fsync for crash durability" — and means it.

### Added

- **`fsync` for crash durability** — temp file is fsync'd before rename; target directory is fsync'd after rename (POSIX only; Windows has no equivalent directory sync)
- **Unique temp file names** — `crypto/rand` 4-byte hex suffix prevents concurrent writer staging-file corruption
- **Platform-specific rename** — split into `rename_unix.go` (single `rename(2)` + directory `fsync`) and `rename_windows.go` (retry loop on `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`/`ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`, 5 retries with exponential backoff 1–16ms, matching Go's own `cmd/go` fix for issue 36568)
- **`writeAndSync()`** — opens temp file, writes data, fsyncs, closes; cleans up temp file on any error
- **`randomSuffix()`** — generates random hex suffix for unique temp file names
- **`syncDir()`** — opens and fsyncs the target directory after rename (POSIX only)
- **`TestWriteLeavesNoLeftoverFiles`** — verifies no `.bak` and no `.tmp` files remain after a successful write
- **Status report** — full HTML dashboard at `docs/status/2026-06-28_03-32_atomicity-durability-overhaul.html`

### Changed

- Package doc: "atomic rename for crash safety" → "atomic rename, and fsync for crash durability"
- `Write()` now stages to a unique temp file instead of a shared `path + ".tmp"`
- `atomicRename()` no longer creates `.bak` files — single `os.Rename` replaces atomically
- `TestConcurrentWriteRACE` rewritten: 10 writers, divergent content, integrity check
- `TestTempFileCleanedUpOnError` uses `filepath.Glob` instead of hardcoded temp path
- AGENTS.md, README.md updated: new architecture, data flow, file structure, platform-specific behavior, removed all `.bak` references
- `go.sum` tidied — removed stale testify/go-spew/go-difflib/yaml.v3 checksums

### Removed

- `TestWriteCreatesBackup` — tested the `.bak` pattern as a feature; the pattern was a bug
- `.bak` file creation — no longer created alongside the target

### Caveats

- Windows rename retry loop and `FlushFileBuffers` compile via build tags but are **untested on real Windows hardware**
- No POSIX-equivalent directory fsync on Windows — the directory entry after rename may not be durable after a crash
- No stale temp file cleanup — crashed writes leave `.tmp` files (unique names prevent interference but don't self-clean)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **LICENSE changed from PROPRIETARY to MIT** — the README already stated MIT; the LICENSE file now matches
- `.golangci.yml` now permits `github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2` and `github.com/gofrs/flock` in the `depguard` allow list (both are intentional runtime dependencies, not candidates for replacement)
- Tests use `//nolint:gosec` annotations with rationale for `os.ReadFile`/`os.WriteFile` calls that operate exclusively on `t.TempDir()` paths
- `TestConcurrentWriteRACE` now calls `t.Parallel()` to satisfy `paralleltest` and to actually run in parallel with other tests
- Benchmark helpers call `b.Helper()` so failures are attributed to the caller
- Variable names lengthened for `varnamelen` compliance: `fp` → `fingerprint`, `wg` → `waitGroup`, `h` → `hasher`, `mb` → `megabyte`
- Inline `if err := …; err != nil { … }` blocks in tests refactored to plain assignment plus `if` for `noinlineerr` compliance
- Documentation formatting and accuracy fixes across README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, DOMAIN_LANGUAGE, and AGENTS.md

### Fixed

- `errcheck`: `h.Write` return value is now explicitly discarded (`_, _ = hasher.Write(…)`) in the streaming benchmark
- `*.bak` added to `.gitignore` — backup files from atomic writes were showing as untracked

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- TOCTOU-safe file writes via xxhash64 fingerprint verification
- Cross-platform file locking (`flock` on Unix, `LockFileEx` on Windows) via `gofrs/flock`
- Atomic rename with `.bak` backup of previous content
- `Fingerprint` type (`[8]byte`) with `IsZero()` and `Matches()` methods
- `FingerprintFile` — computes fingerprint from file path (zero-value for nonexistent files)
- `FingerprintFromBytes` — computes fingerprint from raw bytes
- `Write(path, data, fingerprint)` — main API with TOCTOU protection
- `ErrConcurrentModification` sentinel error for fingerprint mismatch detection
- File permission preservation from existing file (defaults to `0644` for new files)
- xxhash64 vs SHA-256 benchmarks demonstrating ~11× speed advantage
- Unit tests, permission preservation tests, and concurrent writer contention test
